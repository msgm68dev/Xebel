# To create a Makefile for the above code, you need to specify the targets, dependencies, and commands for each file. You also need to define some variables for the compiler, flags, and libraries. Here is a possible Makefile for the above code:

# Define the compiler
CXX = g++

# Define the flags
CXXFLAGS = -Wall -std=c++11

# Define the libraries
LIBS = -lpthread

# Define the source files
# SRCS = xerop.cpp xeror.cpp main.cpp
SRCS = main.cpp

# Define the object files
OBJS = $(SRCS:.cpp=.o)

# Define the executable file
EXE = app

# The default target
all: $(EXE)

# The rule to build the executable
$(EXE): $(OBJS)
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -o $@ $^ $(LIBS)

# The rule to build the object files
%.o: %.cpp
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $<

# The rule to clean the files
clean:
	rm -f $(OBJS) $(EXE)

# The rule to run the executable
run: $(EXE)
	./$(EXE)

# To use this Makefile, you need to save it in the same directory as the source files, and then run the command make in the terminal. This will compile and link the files and produce the executable app. You can also run the command make clean to remove the object and executable files, or make run to run the executable.
